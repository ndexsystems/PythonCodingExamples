PythonCodingExamples

The PythonCodingExamples repository provides a starting point for connecting to the Ndex Systems (www.ndexsystems.com)
Data Utilities API's, SFTP servers and other data sources for creating customizable user interfaces as well as real-time 
data and portfolio analytics dashboards.

Ndex captures financial data from any source – custodian direct feeds, web-portals, PDF statements, custom Excel templates – 
into one unified application.

Ndex provides access to data fed directly from over 270 custodians and over 7500 website through a single portal.

Getting Started
This project is a starting point for a Python Streamlit application and provides information on connecting to data 
acquired by Ndex Systems by several means.

For more information on getting started with Streamlit visit https://streamlit.io/.
